# Prediction_of_disease_outbreaks
Overview:-
This repository contains a collection of machine learning models designed to predict the likelihood of three significant health conditions: Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson's Disease. By leveraging various datasets and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide insights into the risk factors associated with these diseases and facilitate early detection, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes.

Objectives:-
Heart Disease Prediction: Develop a model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data, including demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

Diabetes Prediction: Create a predictive model to assess the risk of diabetes in individuals using clinical and laboratory data, enabling timely interventions and lifestyle modifications.

Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Implement a model to identify the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on voice and speech analysis, which can serve as a non-invasive screening tool.

Datasets:-
The project utilizes publicly available datasets for each disease:

Heart Disease Dataset: Contains patient records with features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health indicators.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset
Diabetes Dataset: Comprises medical records of patients, including glucose levels, BMI, age, and other factors that contribute to diabetes risk.

Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Database
Parkinson's Disease Dataset: Features voice recordings and related metrics that help in predicting the presence of Parkinson's disease.
